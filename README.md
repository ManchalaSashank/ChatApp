## Project Description

**Relay** is a fully functional, real-time messaging platform built with a modern tech stack. It allows users to sign up, log in, view other users, and exchange messages instantly. The app supports both text and media messages, and provides a responsive, dark-themed interface for a polished user experience.

The backend securely manages user authentication and session handling, while the frontend offers a smooth messaging experience with dynamic updates and media previews.

## Key Features

**User Authentication:**

*   Secure sign up and login using **bcryptjs** for password hashing.
*   **JWT-based** token system stored in HTTP-only cookies for session protection.
*   Option to persist sessions or expire on browser close.

**Real Time Messaging**:

*   Instant delivery of messages using **WebSockets**.
*   Automatic message updates between users without needing refresh.

**Media Sharing:**

*   Supports sending images and videos in chat.
*   Media files are uploaded to **Cloudinary** and rendered with inline previews.

**User Presence:**

*   Dynamically displays which users are currently online.
*   User list updates in real time based on socket connection state.

**Polished UI/UX:**

*   Built with **TailwindCSS**, **Radix UI**, and **ShadCN** components.
*   Dark mode styling across all pages.
*   Profile dropdown with logout and user info options.

**Modular Architecture:**

*   Backend uses **Express.js** (ESM) with clear separation of routes, controllers, models, and middlewares.
*   Frontend uses Next.js App Router, with context for global user state, organized components, and axios-based API communication.
